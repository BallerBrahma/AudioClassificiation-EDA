Used a data set from https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/download-urbansound8k.html that contains 8700+ sounds categroized by type
Extracted features using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients for every audio file
Created a model using TensorFlow and MFCC to predict the category of a sound using the signal and waves from each audio file
Utilized librosa, matplotlib, scipy.io, pandas, tqdm, and numpy libraries
